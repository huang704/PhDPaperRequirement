**Contribution statement from Advisor:**  

>Ting's paper "Combining Precursor and Fragment Information for Improved Detection of Differential Abundance in Data Independent Acquisition" was accepted to Molecular & Cellular Proteomics (MCP) on December 30, 2019. MCP is a premier journal in proteomics, with impact factor 4.828 in 2018. MCP leads the field in setting standards to promote reproducibility in proteomics research. 

>This work was part of Ting's summer internship at Biognosis in 2017. Ting was responsible for the vast majority of the work on this paper. She designed the research that combines multiple sources of information in data independent acquisition mass spectrometry to improve the detection of differential abundant proteins. In particular, Ting developed a linear mixed-effect model and implemented the data analysis workflow in R that relies on the model. She evaluated the proposed model on seven experimental datasets, which were generated by Biognosis. The workflow will be included in Spectronaut, a commercial software package from Biognosis. Ting wrote the method and experimental results sections of the paper, which was then edited by other co-authors and me. 

>This work has contributed to the community of mass spectrometry-based proteomics by showing that the combination of multiple sources of information has a high potential for future statistical analysis of data independent acquisition data.
